        <h1>11 November 2021</h1>
        <p>Yesterday, I learned about building hyperlinks in HTML. This led me to building this current version of the navigation menu, which leads to different folders and future projects I hope to build. One such project, is this personal website describing my journey into Web Development.
           As part of my first steps to learning Web Development, I am following along the Developer Documents from Mozilla. Today, I will be learning about additional ways of marking up text.

        <p>Thanks for reading,</p>
