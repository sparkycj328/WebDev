        <p>Yesterday, I learned about building hyperlinks in HTML. This led me to building this current version of the navigation menu, which leads to different folders and future projects I hope to build. One such project, is this personal website describing my journey into Web Development.
           As part of my first steps to learning Web Development, I am following along the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting"><cite>Developer Documents</cite></a>from Mozilla. Today, I will be learning about additional ways of marking up text.      
        </p>
        <p>Edit: One such way was actually added to cite the Document used for today's studying.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading,</p>
        <p><em>Carlos</em></p>
