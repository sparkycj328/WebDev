		<p>Today is 11/09/2020, and I am plunging into learning the basics of Web Development. To begin, I am learning HTML and this page will serve as a sort of blog/progress tracker to keep myself accountable.The most important parts to learn are as follows: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>Javascript</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Visit my <a title="Personal Github" href="https://github.com/sparkycj328" target="_blank">github</a> to view additional progress! This first project will be store in the WebDev repo.</p>
		<p>In HTML, you define a paragraph using the &lt;p&gt; element</p>
