                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Mangu is a typical breakfast dish served in the Dominican Republic (D.R.). 
                    Most often, green plaintains are boiled, with or without the peel still attached. 
                    Once the plantains are soft enough, they are mashed with a fork in the pot in which they were cooked. 
                    After mashing until soft, it is topped with sauteed red onions if desired. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Mangu can be eaten on its own, many natives of the <abbr title="Dominican Rebuplic">D.R</abbr>
                    actually prefer to add side dishes to their favorite breakfast. 
                    One of these side dishes is Dominican-style salami. 
                    It is sliced and then fried and served alongside the Mangu.
                    Cheese, another side dish, is actually fried as well before being served.
